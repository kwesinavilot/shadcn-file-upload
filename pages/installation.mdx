# Installation

There are two ways to add shadcn-file-upload to your project: installing it as a package or copying the component directly into your project.

## Option 1: Install as a Package

To install shadcn-file-upload as a package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install shadcn-file-upload
```

or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add shadcn-file-upload
```

After installation, you can import and use the component in your React files:

```jsx
import FileUpload from 'shadcn-file-upload';
```

## Option 2: Copy and Paste

If you prefer to have more control over the component or want to modify it directly, you can copy the `FileUpload.jsx` file into your project:

1. Download the [`FileUpload.jsx`](https://github.com/kwesinavilot/shadcn-file-upload/blob/main/src/FileUpload.jsx) file from the GitHub repository.
2. Place the file in your project's components directory (or any preferred location).
3. Import the component in your React files:

```jsx
import FileUpload from './path/to/FileUpload';
```

## Dependencies

shadcn-file-upload relies on the following dependencies:

- React
- react-dropzone
- lucide-react
- @radix-ui/react-slot (via shadcn/ui)

Make sure these are installed in your project. If you're using shadcn/ui, you likely already have most of these dependencies installed.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

If you're using Tailwind CSS (which is recommended for shadcn/ui projects), ensure your `tailwind.config.js` file includes the necessary paths:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // Add the path to where you've placed FileUpload.jsx
  ],
  // ...
}
```

With these steps completed, you're ready to start using shadcn-file-upload in your project!
