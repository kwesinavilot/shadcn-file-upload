## Why shadcn-file-upload?

While working on a project using shadcn/ui, I realized there wasn't a drag-and-drop file upload component that fit my needs. I created this component to not only work well with shadcn/ui but also offer flexibility in terms of layout and functionality. I'm excited to share it with the community and hope it proves useful in your projects!
